# Manage EC2 Image Builder infrastructure configuration<a name="manage-infra-config"></a>

After you have created infrastructure configurations with Image Builder, you can manage them using the Image Builder console, through the Image Builder API, or with imagebuilder commands in the AWS CLI\.

**Tip**  
When you have multiple resources of the same type, tagging helps you to identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it\. For more information about tagging your resources using Image Builder commands in the AWS CLI, see the [Tag resources](tag-resources.md) section of this guide\.

This section covers how to list, view, and create infrastructure configurations\.
