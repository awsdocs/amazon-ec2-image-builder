# Use documents in AWSTOE<a name="image-builder-application-documents"></a>

To build a component, you must provide a YAML\-based document, which represents the phases and steps to create the component\.

**Topics**
+ [Document sections](#document-sections)
+ [Input and output chaining](#document-chaining)
+ [Document schema and definitions](#document-schema)
+ [Document example schemas](#document-example)

## Document sections<a name="document-sections"></a>

The sections of a document are as follows\.
+ **Phases**\. Phases are a logical grouping of steps\.
  + Each phase name must be unique within a document\.
  + You can define many phases in a document\.
  + Image Builder runs phases called build, validate, and test in the image build pipeline\.
+ **Steps**\. Steps are individual units of work that comprise the workflow for each phase\.
  + Each step must define the action to take\.
  + Each step must have a unique name per phase\.
  + Steps are run sequentially\.
  + Both the input and output of a step can be used as inputs for a subsequent step\. This is called “chaining”\. 
  + Each step uses an action module that returns an exit code\. 
+ **Supported actions**\. Supported actions must be contained for each step in a document\. Each supported action correlates to an action module\. For a complete list of supported action modules, how they work, input/output values, and examples, see [Action modules supported by AWSTOE component manager](image-builder-action-modules.md)\.
+ **Output files**\. The configuration management application creates the following output files each time the application is run:
  + **detailedOutput\.json**: A file that describes all of the detailed information about the orchestration\. Contains information about each phase, step, and the action that occurs when the application is run\. 
  + **document\.yaml**: The file that is sent to the application to be run\. After the application runs, this file is stored as an artifact\.
  + **console\.log**: Contains all of the standard out \(stdout\) and standard error \(stderr\) information captured while the application is running\. 
  + **application\.log**: Contains the logs generated by debugging instances\. 

## Input and output chaining<a name="document-chaining"></a>

The AWSTOE configuration management application provides a feature for chaining inputs and outputs by writing references in the following formats:

`{{ phase_name.step_name.inputs/outputs.variable }}`

or

`{{ phase_name.step_name.inputs/outputs[index].variable }}`

The chaining feature allows you to recycle code and improve the maintainability of the document\.

The usage requirements of chaining are as follows:
+ Chaining expressions can be used only in the inputs section of each step\.
+ Statements with chaining expressions must be enclosed in quotes\. For example:
  + **Invalid expression**: `echo {{ phase.step.inputs.variable }}`
  + **Valid expression**: `"echo {{ phase.step.inputs.variable }}"`
  + **Valid expression**: `'echo {{ phase.step.inputs.variable }}'`
+ Chaining expressions can reference variables from other steps and phases in the same document\. 
+ Indexes in chaining expressions follow 0\-based indexing \(first index is 0\)\.

**Examples**

To refer to the source variable in the second entry of the following example step, the chaining pattern is `{{ build.SampleS3Download.inputs[1].source }}`\.

```
phases:
  -
    name: 'build'
    steps:
      -
        name: SampleS3Download
        action: S3Download
        timeoutSeconds: 60
        onFailure: Abort
        maxAttempts: 3
        inputs:
          -
            source: 's3://sample-bucket/sample1.ps1'
            destination: 'C:\sample1.ps1'
          -
            source: 's3://sample-bucket/sample2.ps1'
            destination: 'C:\sample2.ps1'
```

To refer to the output variable \(equal to "Hello"\) of the following example step, the chaining pattern is `{{ build.SamplePowerShellStep.outputs.stdout }}`\.

```
phases:
  -
    name: 'build'
    steps:
      -
        name: SamplePowerShellStep
        action: ExecutePowerShell
        timeoutSeconds: 120
        onFailure: Abort
        maxAttempts: 3
        inputs:
          commands:
            - 'Write-Host "Hello"'
```

## Document schema and definitions<a name="document-schema"></a>

The following is the YAML schema for a document\.

```
name: (optional)
description: (optional)
schemaVersion: "string"

phases:
  - name: "string"
    steps:
        - name: "string"
          action: "string"
          timeoutSeconds: integer
          onFailure: "Abort|Continue|Ignore"
          maxAttempts: integer
          inputs:
```

| timeoutSeconds |  Number of seconds that the step runs before failing or retrying\.  Also, supports \-1 value, which indicates infinite timeout\. 0 and other negative values are not allowed\.  | Integer |  Yes  | 7,200 sec \(120 mins\) | 
| onFailure |  Specifies what the step should do in case of failure\. Valid values are as follows:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/image-builder-application-documents.html)  |  String  |  Yes  | Abort | 
| maxAttempts | Maximum number of attempts allowed before failing the step\. | Integer |  No  | 1 |
