CIS creates and maintains a set of configuration guidelines, known as the CIS Benchmarks, which provide configuration best practices for specific technologies, including operating systems, cloud platforms, applications, databases, and more\. CIS Benchmarks are recognized as an industry standard by organizations and standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, DoD Cloud Computing SRG, FISMA, DFARS, and FEDRAMP\.

When you subscribe to a CIS Hardened Image in AWS Marketplace, you also get access to the associated AWS Task Orchestrator and Executor \(AWSTOE\) component that runs a script to enforce CIS Benchmarks Level 1 guidelines for your configuration\. The CIS organization owns and maintains CIS hardening components to ensure that they reflect the latest guidelines\.
