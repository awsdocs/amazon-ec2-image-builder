# Use cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder<a name="cron-expressions"></a>

Use cron expressions for EC2 Image Builder to set up a time window to refresh your image with updates that apply to your pipeline's source image and components\. The time window for your pipeline refresh starts with the time you set in the cron expression\. You can set the time in your cron expression down to the minute\. Your pipeline build can run on or after the start time\.

It can sometimes take a few seconds, or up to a minute for your build to start running\.

**Note**  
Cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time \(UTC\)\. For more information about UTC time, and to find the offset for your time zone, see [Time Zone Abbreviations â€“ Worldwide List](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/)\.

## Supported values for cron expressions in Image Builder<a name="ib-cron-support"></a>

EC2 Image Builder uses a cron format that consists of six required fields\. Each one is separated from the others by a space in between, with no leading or trailing spaces:

`<Minute> <Hour> <Day> <Month> <Day of the week> <Year>`

The following table shows supported values for required cron entries\.


**Supported values for cron expressions**  

| Field | Values | Wildcards | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Minute | 0\-59 | , \- \* / | 
| Hour | 0\-23 | , \- \* / | 
| Day | 1\-31 | , \- \* ? / L W | 
| Month | 1\-12 or jan\-dec | , \- \* / | 
| Day of the week | 1\-7 or mon\-sun | , \- \* ? L \# | 
| Year | 1970\-2199 | , \- \* / | 

**Wildcards**  
The following table describes how Image Builder uses wildcards for cron expressions\. Keep in mind that it can take up to a minute after the time you specify for the build to start\.


**Supported wildcards for cron expressions**  

| Wildcard | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| , | The , \(comma\) wildcard includes additional values\. In the Month field, jan,feb,mar includes January, February, and March\. | 
| \- | The \- \(dash\) wildcard specifies ranges\. In the day of the month field, 1\-15 includes days 1 through 15 of the specified month\. | 
| \* | The \* \(asterisk\) wildcard includes all valid values for the field\.  | 
| ? | The ? \(question mark\) wildcard specifies that the field value depends on another setting\. In the case of the Day and Day\-of\-week fields, when one is specified or includes all possible values \(\*\), the other must be a ?\. You cannot specify both\. For example, if you enter a 7 in the Day field \(run the build on the seventh day of the month\), the Day\-of\-week position must contain a ?\.  | 
| / | The / \(forward slash\) wildcard specifies increments\. For example, if you want your build to run every other day, enter \*/2 in the day field\. | 
| L | The L wildcard in either of the day fields, specifies the last day: 28\-31 for the day of the month, depending on what the month is, or Sunday, for the day of the week\. | 
| W | The W wildcard in the Day\-of\-month field specifies a weekday\. In the Day\-of\-month field, if you enter a number prior to the W, that means you want to target the weekday that is closest to that day\. For instance, if you specify 3W, you want your build to run on the weekday closest to the third day of the month\. | 
| \# | The \# \(hash\) is allowed only for the day of the week field, and must be followed by a number between 1 and 5\. The number specifies which weeks in a given month apply for the build to run\. For example, if you want your build to run on the second Friday of each month, use fri\#2 for the day of the week field\. If you want your job to run twice a month, on the second and fourth Saturday of the month, you would use sat\#2,4 for the day of the week field\. | 

**Restrictions**
+ You can't specify the Day\-of\-month and Day\-of\-week fields in the same cron expression\. If you specify a value or `*` in one of these fields, you must use a `?` in the other\.
+ Cron expressions that lead to rates faster than one minute are not supported\.

## Examples of cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder<a name="ib-cron-examples"></a>

Cron expressions are entered differently for the Image Builder console, than they are for the API or CLI\. To see examples, choose the tab that applies to you\.

------
#### [ Image Builder console ]

The following examples show cron expressions that you can enter into the console for your build schedule\. UTC time is specified using a 24\-hour clock\.

**Run daily at 10:00 AM \(UTC\)**  
`0 10 * * ? *`

**Run daily at 12:15 PM \(UTC\)**  
`15 12 * * ? *`

**Run daily at midnight \(UTC\)**  
`0 0 * * ? *`

**Run at 10:00 AM \(UTC\) every weekday morning**  
`0 10 ? * 1-5 *`

**Run at 6 PM \(UTC\) every weekday evening**  
`0 18 ? * mon-fri *`

**Run at 8:00 AM \(UTC\) on the first day of every month**  
`0 8 1 * ? *`

**Run on the second Tuesday of every month at 10:30 PM \(UTC\)**  
`30 22 ? * tue#2 *`

**Tip**  
If you don't want your pipeline job to extend into the next day while it's running, make sure that you factor in time for your build when you specify the start time\.

------
#### [ API/CLI ]

The following examples show cron expressions that you can enter for your build schedule using CLI commands or API requests\. Only the cron expression is shown\.

**Run daily at 10:00 AM \(UTC\)**  
`cron(0 10 * * ? *)`

**Run daily at 12:15 PM \(UTC\)**  
`cron(15 12 * * ? *)`

**Run daily at midnight \(UTC\)**  
`cron(0 0 * * ? *)`

**Run at 10:00 AM \(UTC\) every weekday morning**  
`cron(0 10 ? * 1-5 *)`

**Run at 6:00 PM \(UTC\) every weekday evening**  
`cron(0 18 ? * mon-fri *)`

**Run at 8:00 AM \(UTC\) on the first day of every month**  
`cron(0 8 1 * ? *)`

**Run on the second Tuesday of every month at 10:30 PM \(UTC\)**  
`cron(30 22 ? * tue#2 *)`

**Tip**  
If you don't want your pipeline job to extend into the next day while it's running, make sure that you factor in time for your build when you specify the start time\.
